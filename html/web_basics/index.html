</h1>

	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em>
		How do we maintain a balance?
	</em>
</p>
<ul>
	Create a redundancy system that retains operators free of automation.
</ul>
<li>
	Create a human centered automation that requires a manual check system.
</li>
<ol>
	Limit the fields in which automation is allowed.
