Semantic tags give meaning to code, allowing the code to be rendered.
Nav has the most specific purpose, making it the most useful.
 It displays from top to bottom
 I learned about creating snippets. Snippets seem very useful, I will definitely make more in the furture.
 There wasn't anything challenging.
