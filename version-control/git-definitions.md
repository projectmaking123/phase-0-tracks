# Git Definitions updated!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
verison control is a means to record changes. It is useful because it can create or update multiple projects from a single base code, and it can also allow the return to a previous state which is useful for debugging. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a sub-file/folder that is based off of a master code, where the master code can be worked on without affecting the master code itself. This allows for multiple users with multiple branchs, all working with a common goal, but ideally on different problems. I would use a branch when working on new code, so as to not tamper with what i know already works.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
When a file has changed, it needs to be added and then commited as a saving point. A good commit message would briefly describe the changes to the file.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is the merge of multiple branchs, and a reconciliation is required to address the differences of the multiple branchs. Conflict markers will identify the differences.
