<em>
	A game that has been dated as far back as 4000 years, still played today in its original design. A simple composition of two sides. Every stone equal in value. There is no race to capture a king, but rather a race to seek balance.
</em>
<p>
	<strong>
		Every move in GO must be made with the intentions of both defending and attacking. To maintain as many options as one can forsee.

The link I added in additional info has mulitple class lists that I do not recongize. I imagine these classes lend different styles to the list. I find the site well structured and easy to navigate.
